# Visual Calculator
The core idea of this project is to calculate hand written equations from images. The images may for example look like:  
* Equation made by concatenating separate digits and operators.  
![example1](testing/proposal_images/eq_concat.png)
* Equation written digitally.  
![example2](testing/proposal_images/eq_computer_gen.png)
* Handwritten equation.  
![example3](testing/proposal_images/eq_handwritten.png)

## Training, Validating and Testing Data
Download these data sets:
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols,
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michelheusser/handwritten-digits-and-operators,
* https://github.com/sueiras/handwritting_characters_database,

rename them respectively to:
* ``handwrittenmathsymbols.zip``,
* ``handwritten-digits-and-operators.zip``,
* ``handwritting_characters_database.tar.gz``

and put the to downloads directory in the root directory of the project.
